# Mutation rate varies at the single-colony level during the in vivo growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) establishes a highly spatially organized sites of infection which can follow very different courses even within the same infected person. It has long been proposed that the different environmental and immune pressures in different sites of infection have different functional consequences for the associated bacterial populations, potentially altering drug efficacy and the emergence of drug resistance. However, there is very little understanding of the evolutionary population dynamics of Mtb within individuals. Here, we prospectively collected sputum samples from 18 newly diagnosed and treatment-na√Øve tuberculosis (TB) patients, and sequenced 795 single colonies to characterize the bacterial genetic diversity. We report that the population diversity of Mtb in different patients varied substantially, with the pairwise SNP distances between any two bacilli cells within a single individual ranging from 0 to 27 SNPs. Phylogenetic reconstruction suggested that the majority of the bacilli population at disease activation was from the recent growth a subpopulation of Mtb within-host. Mutation rate varied considerably between different bacilli isolated from the same individual, resulted in distinct numbers of de novo SNPs in different cells. The enhanced mutation rate was consistent with reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced mutagenesis. We further show that such variation of mutation rate was host-dependent and was associated with the immune status of hosts. These results show that mutation rate of Mtb in vivo is modulated by the host environment, which could facilitate the emergence of variants associated with drug resistance.
